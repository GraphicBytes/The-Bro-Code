# The-Bro-Code

A user driven platform I built back in 2017 that allows users to build and vote on "The Bro Code", the project is currently live at https://brocode.org

I was a fan of the TV show How I Met Your Mother and I enjoyed the references to The Bro Code, so I thought it would be cool to build a platform that allowed users to sign up and help suggest and vote on new Bro Codes, including how each Bro Code is worded.
